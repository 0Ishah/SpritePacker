        Not my best webpage, but its good enough ヾ(-_- )ゞ <br>
        Here is a <a href="https://github.com/9HABIBI/SpritePacker">GitHub repository</a> for this project if anyone is interested<br><br>
        Thank you for using Sprite Packer. This manual will describe and show how to use all of the features in this program.
        <br>Please consider supporting the author, morally and financially.
        <br>Don't look at the spelling error, English is not my strongest subject.

	<div class="describtion">
		<p>This program is designed to create sprite sheets for animation using separate files or a gif animation.
			<br>To create a sprite sheet from the separate frames, first select the frames in the right order.
			<br>You can always add more frames or clear selected frames if needed. Keep in mind: image sizes must be 
			<br>the same size for the animation to work properly. If the frames have different sizes, the final 
			<br>sprite sheet will be resized.
			<br>To create a sprite sheet form a .gif animation, simply select the file, and the program will do
			<br>everything.</p>

		Here are the examples of different sprite sheet alignments that are available:
